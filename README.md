## Stefano Magni's ([@NoriSte](https://github.com/NoriSte)) notes

Thank you for your time ðŸ˜Š you can find the solution in the `noriste-frontend-coding-challenge-2023` branch.

I report some notes about the implementation after the feedback I received from Vesim Demeni: the general feedback was

1. To carefully follow the instructions
2. To not over-complicate the problems and be ready to justify my decisions in the tech interview

That means that a list of possible improvements is not in the solution, such as:

- The eventual server errors are not stored Redux nor propagated back to the caller
- The prompts/confirmations do not tell the user why the tournament name is not valid
- There is no abort logic for outgoing requests
- There are no tests
- There is no optimistic flag in the tournament created/updated (that could simplify the optimistic updates)
- There is no race condition management among the various create/edit/delete/search actions
- The solution takes for granted that it's the only consumer of the server, and the tournaments cannot be changed by someone else

Additional notes:

1. I have not used ChatGPT
2. I followed the Redux docs in order to correctly type the actions and thunks
3. I have not put all the name validations in a single Regex since I think the current implementation is more readable
4. I rebuilt the branch's history to ease readability, the same thing sometimes I do for regular PRs
